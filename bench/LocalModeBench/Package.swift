// swift-tools-version: 6.1
// Tiny harness that measures Local Mode inference on the actual dev
// machine — same model, same cache directory, same generation parameters
// as LocalChatProvider. The README's benchmark numbers come from here and
// from the in-app latency badge, never from guesses.
